# Prework Webpage English/Portuguese(BR)

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript, with a few websites that i thought that was a good start for those that are just at the beginning, i decided to translate a few topics to my native language portugues in case i want to show to someone that does not speak English.
